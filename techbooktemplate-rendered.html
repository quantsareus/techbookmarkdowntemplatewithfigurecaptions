<h1 id="chapter-1---why-is-authoring-in-markdown-superior">Chapter 1 -
Why is authoring in markdown superior?</h1>
<p>The main weakness of authoring apps with a binary document format is
the handling of images and other embedded content. When importing an
image for a figure, they do embed a copy of the image in the binary
document. But in the final layouting process you may get aware, that the
figure images are not standardized enough, do contain errors or the
image resolution is to low for printing. But there is no automatic
update process in place; you have to delete every image manually and
replace it one-by-one by a new version. In mdown format however, images
are just linked into the text. When you need to update the images, you
just modify the images in the source directory and keep the same name.
On the next rendering of the mdown document they get updated fully
automatically.</p>
<p>Further, most office writing applications, e.g MS Word, Libreoffice
and Openoffice, will get unstable once the document reaches a certain
size. Any image added to the document in print quality blows it up for
at least 1 MB. When the document is opened on the monitor display for
editing, it requires multiples of memory space of that, in order to
provide separately editable objects. Most university students do
experience during writing a master or Phd thesis, that an office writing
application gets unstable, once the document includes a certain number
of figures, layout formats and automatic indexing components. Dramatic
recovery operations of a hanging final stage thesis in MS Word have been
a common daily job at university over decades and still are. Often the
latest edits cannot get recovered any more and have to be typed in, once
again. Sometimes, even a whole new Windows machine is needed to finish
the thesis.</p>
<p>Last, when starting writing a new technical book you do not know, how
the authoring process will be organized in future, especially how
sought-after your work might once get. With the mdown text format you
can collaborate with other authors. As far the document is in a
<em>markup text format</em>, you can scale up the authoring project to
dozens of authors and lecturers working in parallel on the manuscript in
minutes. Then gitbook or collaborative (cloud) editors do provide all
the integration services for the different manuscript versions received
from the authors, you need for version control. But there are no
professional integration services for a binary document format.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2---basic-mdown-syntax">Chapter 2 - Basic Mdown
Syntax</h1>
<p>A few introducing words about mdown syntax, first. The basic mdown
syndax contains the syntax elements of the so called commonmark spec.
This is the mdown version, that John Gruber published in 2004.
Additionally, there is the extended mdown syntax, which also is
correctly translated by most mdown processors. On top of that there are
mdown extensions and mdown dialects, of which (sometimes proprietary)
syntax elements can only be translated on the corresponding mdown
processsor. This techbook mdown template on purpose keeps limited to
commonmark spec and extended mdown syntax for compatibility reasons.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-3---figures">Chapter 3 - Figures</h1>
<p>Figures are very important components of technical books. Often
figures are more interesting than the accompanying text. Thus, a
professional technical book requires a list of figures, where the reader
can look them up.</p>
<h2 id="image-based-figures">Image Based Figures</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no figure caption syntax in commonmark spec
or in extended syntax. To get maximum compatibility in all mdown
processors we do apply the figure html-tag, instead. As long the mdown
document gets pre-rendered to a html document first, we can extend the
mdown syntax any time with html syntax, when we do require more syntax.
A mixing of mdown syntax and html syntax does only work, as far a text
line does contain either mdown or html syntax, but not both in one line.
A mdown processor translates a mdown text line by line.</p>

<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
<p>There is no table caption syntax in commonmark spec or in extended
syntax, either. So, to keep it simple, we simply define a table as
another figure. This does not allow for a separate list of tables.
However, a table - depending on the application source - can technically
be a text, an image or an OLE object, which all do have individual
caption marks. Of course, the reader does not want to look up figures in
different tables depending on their internal technical nature. Thus,
listing all kinds of figures straight up in one list of figures is an
attractive option.</p>

extended markdown syntax.</p>
<h2 id="code-listings">Code Listings</h2>
<h3 id="inline-code">Inline Code</h3>
<p>First of all there is inline code. E.g. at the command prompt, type
<code>nano</code>.</p>
<h3 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h3>
<p>There are two options to create a code block. The first option is to
intend code by one tab or four spaces. However, this is not very handy,
because every code line requires the indention and has to be closed by a
double return.</p>
<p>The second code block option is a syntax element out of extended
markdown syntax. Here a code block is embedded between three tick marks
(```) or three tildes (∼∼∼), depending on your mdown processor. This
option is much more handy; the code can get copy&amp;paste in, just like
it is.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also want to embed the code block in a figure tag,
so that it will appear in the list of figures.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-5---final-advices">Chapter 5 - Final Advices</h1>
<p>Believe it or not, these are the important mdown syntax elements for
a technical book already, such as a programming book, a scientific book,
a manual or a technical documentation. For your first learning steps
just copy&amp;paste the mdown elements of the template and put your
content in. There are some further details here and there, you can look
up on the internet. But always keep in mind, that mdown is - and should
be - a simple easy writing language, made to keep you fluent in pinning
down your ideas. It roughly pre-structures the text components, so that
they <strong>later on</strong> can get properly layouted, even to a
professional commercial print book or e-book using a dtp software. If
you want to use dtp software for the final layout, ideally perform a
test run, first, in which document format to feed the dtp software at
best. E.g. with the techbooktemplate.</p>
<p>During the learning period of mdown language an mdown editor
including a markdown processor (rendering feature) may be helpful. Some
Linux based mdown editors with a rendering feature are Haroopad (an
editor to create blog posts, slides, presentations, reports) and
Openmarkup editor (a simple editor). There is a continuous stream of new
editors and new extension features for all operating systems. Google:
Mdown editor with render function/functionality/feature. There are also
web-based online editors, such as dillinger.io. Do not choose an online
editor for a real book project, except you really are always online.
Also think about writing on vacation, on the train and on holiday. As
far you have already worked out a structural concept of the book, the
typing process - for time management reasons - can also take place in
side time periods, that hardly could be used for brainy, highly
concentrated work loads. To some degree writing a book is simply
typing.</p>
<p>Good success!</p>
